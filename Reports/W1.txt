Weekly Report: Week 1

Name: Van Quang Nguyen

The first week was devoted to introduce the content of the course as 
well as evaluation method. There were two import keys in this week's lectures:

1. Introduction to distributed storing systems, in particular, Hadoop. 
According to my knowledge, the main difference to the classical storage 
systems is that data is divided and replicated to be stored in many nodes 
and hence, if in some cases, some nodes are broken, the data is still 
accessed from the other nodes. Data nodes are under the observation of 
a name node which stores address of all data nodes. Because of its importance, 
there must be a back up of the name node.

2. Over all review of GIT, Docker, Bash, and Python with some exercises 
in coding simple examples with Python.


The instructor showed his listening to all our questions and give his 
explanations. I still found some not very clear (at least to me) explanation, 
but maybe because of my English. The group discussions for some questions 
were interesting and useful.

For the next courses, I am looking forward to learning on details about 
distributed storing systems such as Hadoop, specifically: (i) How useful 
is it? (ii) How to use it to manage large data sets? and (iii) How to 
incorporate with Python or other elements we learned such as Docker.
